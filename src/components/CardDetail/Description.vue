        Gather your friends to the battle arena and duel it out! CubeDown is an immersive 2-player game that allows you to challenge your friends across 3 grueling modes. Play on the same device as you try to outplay your opponent! Cube Dodge is a spin off on the classic tag game. Play 2 rounds, of tag, while trying to last longer in the arena. Cube Football tests your footy skills, as you challenge your friend for a game of football. Cube Run has you race against the clock in the perilous arena. Gather points as you complete each lap. However, the odds are against you as you race across the bomb infested arena while avoiding the danger zone!
